# Gabriela Lahera - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hello, I'm Gabriela! I have a background in ad-hoc data querying, data cleaning, visualization, and analytics, as well as varied experience as an educator. I seek to continue working with large complex datasets (previous experience in English and Spanish) and to developed a keen eye for ways to improve team efficiency. Complimentary, I have training in intergroup dialogue, conflic remediation, and effictive communication skills.

While completing my studies, I honed my ability to be a quick and independent learner, this included programming languages (Stata & Python), and synthezing and organizing large bodies of economic theory. I also gained experience in explaining complex topics, data management, and regression analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist when interacting with different stakeholders.

In my free time, I enjoy reading up on mathematical models, history, and new data tools; I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems. 

My CV in [pdf]().

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects I have contributed to and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
